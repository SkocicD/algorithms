This problem had three repeating steps day 1 took step 1, 2 took 2, 3 took 3, 4 took 1, etc.
The question was how many days to get to a certain number n steps.

what you could do was take n//(a+b+c) where a,b,c are the step sizes to see how many times the 3 day cycle is repeated, then just find 0 1 or 2 leftover steps that finish n-(n//(a+b+c))
